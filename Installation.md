    1. [Read Carefully the first part here](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=foreword&lang=en)
    
    1. Install Python 3.7 and Hello World
        - Goal: install and see what to do with Python
        - Python 2.7 will not be used at all during the class. Python 2.7 is the last version of python 2.
        - We will use Python 3. Any python 3 version is OK. Currently the most recent version is 3.8; we can use it. Personally I use 3.7 and I recommend you to use 3.7 too because 3.8 is too new. 
        - Let's use Python 3.7.x (Python 3.6.x is good too).
        - Go to [downloads for python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), choose Python 3.7.6
            - Or, go directly to [python 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/)
            - Choose a 64 bit installer for Windows or Mac OS X
            - Linux OS is equipped with Python 3, so no install is required. If you want to try Linux in your desktop machine, install [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/). [64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ubuntu-18.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso) is the installation file for CD/DVD/USB installation.

            - For Windows 10 installation, don't forget to check both of the check buttons at the starting window of installation!

            ![Click BOTH of the buttons](https://github.com/yongduek/cor1009/blob/master/etc/python-install.png)
        
    1. Install PyGame and other Libraries
        1. Open `command prompt` or `powershell` 
        
            ![open command prompt](https://github.com/yongduek/cor1009/blob/master/etc/cmd_prompt.png)
            
        2. Run `pip install pygame`

    - Extra if you have time:
        1. Go to [Pygame Installlation](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted), install pygame
        1. Run the aliens game:
            `python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens`
        1. What is your best score?
