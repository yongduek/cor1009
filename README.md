# GKS COR-1009

- Every submission should be a python source code or in an electronic form of '.pdf'. Convert your document to Adobe pdf, which is just a simple process.
    - Warning: Don't ever try to buy a pdf writer from Adobe in order to perform pdf conversion of your document, unless you are really happy to spend the money to do many other things let alone preparing homework submissions for this course.

- Asking google or stackoverflow to find a clue is good behavor. 
- You can help your classmates. However, always be cautious not to deprive your classmates of the pleasure of learning computer language.
- Cheating is never allowed. It will ruin your life eventually. 

- [Questions can be posted here](https://github.com/yongduek/cor1009/issues), and anybody may provide answers.

1. Install Python 3.7 and Hello World
    - Goal: install and see what to do with Python
    - Python 2.7 will not be used at all during the class. Python 2.7 is the last version of python 2.
    - We will use Python 3. Any python 3 version is OK. Currently the most recent version is 3.8; we can use it. Personally I use 3.7 and I recommend you to use 3.7 too because 3.8 is too new. 
    - Let's use Python 3.7.x (Python 3.6.x is good too).
    - Go to [downloads for python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), choose Python 3.7.6
        - Or, go directly to [python 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/)
        - Choose a 64 bit installer for Windows or Mac OS X
        - Linux OS is equipped with Python 3, so no install is required. If you want to try Linux in your desktop machine, install [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/). [64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ubuntu-18.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso) is the installation file for CD/DVD/USB installation.
            
        - For Windows 10 installation, don't forget to check both of the check buttons at the starting window of installation!
        ![Click BOTH of the buttons](https://github.com/yongduek/cor1009/blob/master/etc/python-install.png)
