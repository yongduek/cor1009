- Every submission should be a python source code or in an electronic form of '.pdf'. Convert your document to Adobe pdf, which is just a simple process.
    - Warning: Don't ever try to buy a pdf writer from Adobe in order to perform pdf conversion of your document, unless you are really happy to spend the money to do many other things let alone preparing homework submissions for this course.

- Asking google or stackoverflow to find a clue is good behavor. 
- You can help your classmates. However, always be cautious not to deprive your classmates of the pleasure of learning computer language.
